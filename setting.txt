### 5. **Charleston, South Carolina**
	-**Historic Estates and Southern Charm:** Charleston's stately homes, Spanish 
moss-covered oaks, and traditional Southern society offer a unique flavor to the 
Victorian romance genre. A grand estate outside Charleston could reflect Sebastian's 
sense of history and old-world tradition.
	-**Social Divisions:** Charleston was a city of complex social and racial 
divides during this period. Evelyn's desire to help those in need could draw her to 
work with communities affected by poverty or the remnants of the Civil War, adding 
layers to her character's empathy and resilience.

In Charleston, South Carolina, during the Victorian era, Daniel's business could be 
tied to industries that reflect both the region's historical context and the social 
issues of the time. Here are a few options that align with his complext brooding 
character and would tie into the era's Southern setting:

### 1. **Shipping and Trade Company**
	-**Details:** Daniel could own a shipping company dealing in textiles, cotton, 
rice, or other goods transported along the East Coast or internationally. Charleston's 
port was one of the busiest on the Atlantic, making this a profitable, prestigious 
business.
	-**Narrative Potential:** The shipping business exposes him to diverse people 
and issues, from port laborers to wealthy merchants, showing him the start divides in 
society. He could be haunted by his family's past involvement in the pre-war slave 
trade and now secretly work to improve conditions for dockworkers, which Nellie may 
later uncover.

### 2. **Rice Plantation and Agricultural Business**
	-**Details:** He might own a rice plantation or agricultural business, which 
was a major industry in South Carolina at the time. Rather than running it as a 
traditional plantation, Sebastian could be moderinizing it, using paid labor and 
sustainable farming practices.
	-**Narrative Potential:** His uncoventional approach might draw suspician from 
other plantation owners and stir up tensions with the local aristocracy. This 
occupation could also add dept to Sebastian's character, as he quietly funds 
educational programs for formerly enslaved people or tenant farmers on his land. Evelyn 
might join in these efforts, seeing his compassion beneath his guarded exterior.

### 3. **Textile Mill or Manufacturing Business**
	-**Details:** Charleston saw growth in textile and cotton mills after the Civil 
War. Sebastian could own a textile manufacturing business that supplies fabrics for the 
Southern states and exports to the North or overseas.
	-**Narrative Potential:** This business would allow him to employ many locals, 
including vulnerable groups like women and children. Evelyn could begin working in the 
community, advocating for better labor conditions, which puts her at odds with him 
initially. As she sees his charitable efforts behind the scenes, her perception of him 
begins to change.

### 4. **Banking and Investment Firm**
	-**Details:** If he's more of an aristocratic businessman, Sebastian might be 
involved in banking and investments. In post-war Charleston, many landowners and former 
plantation owners needed loans, making banking both profitable and controversion.
	-**Narrative Potential:** Banking would give him influence over Charleston's 
elite, adding social tension. Sebastian might be known as a formidable, calculating 
figure who funds new industrial projects or infrastructure. Evelyn could discover that 
he quietly invests in affordable housing or educational institutions for the community, 
revealing his altruistic side.

### 5. **Distillery or Brewery**
	-**Details:** Distilleries and breweries were common ventures among wealthy 
businessmen looking to diversify. Sebastian could own a successful whisky distillery, 
supplying high-quality spirits to Charleston and beyond.
	-**Narrative POtential:** This business could carry a rebellious undertone, as 
temperance movements were gaining traction. Evelyn might diapprive initially, but later 
discover that he donates a portion of the profilts to local charities. The distillery's 
workers and the conditions they face could also bring the characters closer togher as 
she advocates for their well-being.

-------------------

Here are some specific Charleston settings and cultural elements you can incorporate 
into your story to add historical richness:

### 1. **Charleston Harbor and The Battery**
	-The harbor would be a key location for smuggling. Daniel's operations could 
involve sneaking goods in under the cover of darkness through the winding waterways and 
inlets.
	-The Battery, with its grand antebellum homes overlooking the water, could be 
where Nelle's family estate is located. This are symbolizes old Southern wealth and 
would contrast sharply with Daniel's secret, law-defying lifestyle.

### 2. **Historic Mansions and Social Balls**
	-Charleston's elite held lavish social gatherings, which could serve as a 
setting where Nellie and Daniel must maintain the facade of a happy marriage. Perhaps 
Nellie's cousin is trying to win favor with the local upper class while scheming to 
take over the family business.
	-These balls can serve as moments of tension, where Nellie begins to suspect 
Daniel is hiding something, or where the customs officer closes in, creating a 
cat-and-mouse game amidst the genteel setting.

### 3. **The Docks and Smuggling Networks**
	-The Charleston docks were a bustling hub of activity. Daniel could have a crew 
of loyal men who assist him in smuggling luxury goods, using hidden warehouses along 
the river.
	-The customs officer investigating Daniel could frequent these docks, adding a 
layer of danger as Daniel tries to keep his illegal activities hidden while managing 
his new role as Nellie's husband.

### 4. **Plantations and Rice Fields**
	-The rural outskirts of Charleston were dotted with plantations and rice 
fields. Perhaps Nellie's grandfather once owned a plantation that has since 
transitioned to a shipping empire, representing the old South transforming into the new 
economy.
	-These plantations could serve as remote locations for Daniel to meet his 
smuggling contacts or hid illicit goods. It could also be a place where Nellie finds 
herself drawn into his world as she uncovers his secret.

### 5. **Fort Sumter**
	-Fort Sumter, the site where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, can 
symbolize the lingering woulds of the war. It could serve as a backdrop for a pivotal 
scene, maybe a confrontation between Daniel and the customs officer. The fort's looming 
presence could reflect the tension between the past and the future, as well as the 
risks Daniel is taking.

### 6. **Gullah Culture**
	-The Gullah people, descendants of enslaved Africans in the Lowcountry, had a 
distinct culture in Charleston during this period. You could weave Gullah traditions, 
folkore, or language into the story, either through characters who are part of Nellie's 
household staff or as people Daniel interacts with on the docks.
	-Perhaps Daniel has trusted Gullah contacts who help him ove goods or offer 
wise counsel. Gullah traditions could add a layer of mysticism or hidden wisdom, 
especially if you want to add a supernatural or folklore twist to the plot.

### 7. **Reconstruction Era Tension**
	-The late 1800s was a period of Reconstruction in the South. Charleston, like 
much of the region, was struggling to rebuild its economy while dealing with Northern 
oversight. This tension could be reflected in how Daniel feels about the federal 
customs agents investigating his smuggling activities.
	-You could explore how Charleston's aristocracy is trying to hold onto old 
wealth and status, while people like Daniel are trying to carve out a new life in the 
changing economic landscape. This might also give Nellie's cousin more motivation to 
seize the family business, as he could represent the old guard clinging to tradition.

### 8. **Charleston Market and Trade**
	-The Charleston City Market, a center of trade during this time, could be a key 
setting for both the legal and illegal exchange of goods. Nellie might bisit the market 
frequently to manage her grandfather's legitimate shipping interests, while Daniel 
could use it to cover up his smuggling activities.
	-The market can also be a place where different classes intersect, giving you 
opportunities to show the contrast between Nellie's world of wealth and privilege and 
Daniel's more dangerous, streetwise life.

### 9. **Hidden Passages and Tunnels**
	-Charleston is famous for its hidden passages and alleys. These could serve as 
secret routes Daniel uses to transport smuggled goods, adding a layer of intrigue and 
danger to the story. Perhaps Nellie stumbles upon one of these secret paths, leading 
her to uncover the truth about Daniel's double life.

### 10. **Weather and Natural Disasters**
	-Charleston's coastal location makes it prone to storms and hurricanes. A 
sudden storm could serve as a dramatic turning point in the novel, trapping characters 
together, or threatening to reveal Daniel's smuggling operations when ships are forced 
into port unexpectedly.
	-The threat of a hurricane could also symbolize the brewing emotional storm 
between Nellie and DAniel as secrets are revealed.
