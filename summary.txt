Summary: (from ChapGPT)

### Adjusted Plot: (for Charleston, South Carolina)

Charleston in the late 1800s was a city with deep cultural roots, still recovering from 
the devastation of the Civil War. **Nellie Barrett**'s grandfather owned a major 
shipping company that helped the family maintain its wealth during REconstructions. The 
stipulation in his will - that she must marry to claim her inheritance - is a nod to 
the Souther societal expectations of women, where marriage often determined a woman's 
security.

**Daniel Whitmore** could be a local sailor familiar with Charleston's labyrinth of 
waterways, using them to smuggle goods into the city. He might smuggle items that are 
in high demand due to post-war shortages, such as luxury goods and foreign imports. His 
smuggling activities are seen as a rebellious act, defying the law and the lingering 
control of Northern influence on Southern trade.

Charleston's charm, cobblestone streets, and historic architecture would make for 
beautiful, atmospheric settings. The cutoms officer investigating Daniel could be a 
Northern agent, adding tension between post-war Southern pride and the encroaching 
federal authorities.

The vibrant culture of Charleston, from its antebellus mansions to the bustling 
waterfront, can serve as a dramatic backdrop for their love story. You can use 
landmarks like the Charleston Harbor, Fort Sumter, and even the Gullah culture that 
would have been prominent at the time to add depth and texture to the story.
